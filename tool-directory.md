# Konnect — Tool Directory

Canonical reference for every MCP tool exposed by Konnect. Generated from the Rust source (not from hand-maintained prose), so it reflects what the binary actually serves.

**Source of truth**
- Toolset metadata + declared counts: `crates/konnect-core/src/router/registry.rs` (`ALL_TOOLSETS`)
- Meta-tool definitions: `crates/konnect-core/src/router/meta_tools.rs` (`meta_tool_descriptions()`)
- Per-tool names + descriptions: `crates/konnect-core/src/tools/<toolset>.rs` (each `tool!(…)` in the `tools()` vec)

## Overview

- **17 toolsets** organized into 10 categories
- **175 registered tools** + **6 always-visible meta-tools** = **181 total**
- **Discovery pattern**: the server pre-loads only the **starter kit** (`project`, `config`) so baseline `tools/list` costs ~2K tokens instead of ~23K. The LLM reads `list_toolboxes` → calls `load_toolset(name)` to expose additional tools on demand; `unload_toolset(name)` prunes them. `tools/list_changed` is notified on every mutation. If the LLM calls a tool whose toolset isn't loaded, the error names the owning toolset so recovery is a single `load_toolset` hop.
- **Observability**: every `tools/call` is recorded — ring buffer of the last 100 calls + per-tool counters + JSONL at `<konnect dir>/logs/calls.jsonl`. The LLM self-diagnoses via `get_recent_calls` and `server_stats`.

## Meta-tools (always visible)

Six tools, grouped into *discovery/routing* and *observability*.

### Discovery / routing

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `list_toolboxes` | List all 17 toolsets with category, tool count, and whether each is currently loaded. The LLM's starting point. |
| `load_toolset` | Load a toolset by name to expose its tools in `tools/list`. Returns the list of tools added. |
| `unload_toolset` | Unload a toolset to prune its tools from `tools/list`. Use when switching tasks to keep context small. |
| `get_active_toolsets` | Return the currently loaded toolsets and how many tools each provides. |

### Observability

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `get_recent_calls` | Last N tool calls (newest first) — `call_id`, tool, toolset, duration, status (ok/error/not_found), `error_kind`. The LLM's debug log. Default limit 20, max 100. |
| `server_stats` | Uptime, total/error call counts, per-tool totals + errors, and the JSONL log path. |

## Appendix: Structural observations

### Is the structure intelligent?

**Yes — the split holds up.** A few observations worth tracking as the tool surface grows:

1. **Categories mirror the KiCAD editor boundaries** — Schematic (`sch_*`), PCB (`pcb_*`), plus library/integration/verification/review/templates/manufacturing as cross-cutting concerns. A new tool's home is usually obvious.

2. **Batch tools are split across two places**:
   - `sch_batch` holds top-level batch primitives (`batch_connect_to_net`, `batch_delete`, `bulk_move_schematic_components`, etc.) plus validation
   - `sch_wiring` / `sch_components` also contain `batch_*` tools (`batch_add_wire`, `batch_delete_no_connect`, `batch_rotate_labels`, `batch_get_schematic_pin_locations`, `batch_delete_schematic_components`, `batch_edit_schematic_components`)
   The split is defensible (tight-scope batches live with their domain; cross-domain batches live in `sch_batch`) but worth a one-paragraph convention note in DEV.md so future additions land consistently.

3. **Cross-toolset cleanups** (historical notes):
   - `search_footprints` and `get_symbol_info` were originally in `verification`; moved to `library` where they belong semantically. Users who were loading `verification` for these will be auto-redirected by the smart "tool not loaded" error.
   - `get_drc_violations` (`pcb_export`) and `run_drc` (`verification`) run the same kicad-cli check. Their tool descriptions now cross-reference each other and steer the LLM toward `run_drc` for interactive use (cleaner summary with error/warning counts) and `get_drc_violations` for bundling into a build package.

### Implementation notes

- The `tool!(name, description, input_schema, handler)` macro lives in `crates/konnect-core/src/tools/mod.rs` and produces a `ToolDef` inserted into each toolset's `tools()` vec.
- Dispatch: `router::registry::tools_for(name)` maps each toolset string to its `tools::<mod>::tools()` vec; `handler.rs` looks up `tools/call` in the currently-loaded toolsets. If the tool exists but its toolset isn't loaded, the error names the owning toolset for single-hop recovery (`router::ToolRouter::find_toolset_for_tool`).
- Some schematic handlers are mid-migration from raw `konnect-sexp` to the typed `konnect-schematic-editor` model (Phase 2 Waves 1–4, see commits `1314ed2`…`f92b3b1`). Tool names and semantics are unchanged; only the internal implementation is in flux.

### Regenerating this doc

The tool list is extracted mechanically from the `tool!(...)` invocations in `crates/konnect-core/src/tools/*.rs`. To regenerate after adding tools, re-run the same extraction and re-verify counts against `registry.rs::ALL_TOOLSETS` — the row count in each table here must equal each toolset's `tool_count`.
